In this project, we consider the problem of reconstructing a nanocrystal at atomic resolution from very few electron microscopy images. In several popular reconstruction approaches, atom locations are confined to a coarse spatial grid, an assumption inspired by the physical a priori knowledge that atoms in a crystalline solid tend to form regular lattices. This constraint, although powerful in solving under-determined problems, makes it much harder to resolve defects that occur widely in atomic lattices. We take inspiration from recent advances in mathematical super-resolution to propose a *grid-free* reconstruction approach that allows for continuous deviations of atom locations. This new formulation also allows us to use atomic interaction potentials as a function of atom positions as a physics-based regulariser.
