I am a PhD student at the [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica](https://www.cwi.nl/research/groups/computational-imaging) and [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/mathematics/analysis-and-dynamical-systems). I apply mathematical tools from inverse problems and optimisation theory to X-ray and electron tomography problems. My research is funded by the European Commission's Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie actions and is part of the [MUMMERING](http://www.mummering.eu/) network.
