I am a first year PhD student at the [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica](https://www.cwi.nl/research/groups/computational-imaging) and [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/mathematics/analysis-and-dynamical-systems). My research in ultrafast 3D and 4D tomography is funded by the European Commission's Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie actions and is part of the [MUMMERING](http://www.mummering.eu/) network.
